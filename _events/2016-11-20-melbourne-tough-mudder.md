We're heading to an exciting new venue in 2016 and we're taking it to a whole new level. Get ready to come face to face with rolling hills, dark bush lands, scrubs and plenty of mud 
Featuring all-new 2016 obstacles, this is going to be one event to remember. Gather your team-mates and commit now, you're orange headband is waiting. 

We will not release actual course details until two weeks before the event. (What, did you think we were going to give it away now?). Stay on your toes and keep training for all possible challenges – you might not know exactly what we have in store for you, but you can bank on plenty of mud, ice, fire, and electric shocks. We intend to make you earn that coveted orange headband…and the ice cold beer waiting for you at the finish line.
