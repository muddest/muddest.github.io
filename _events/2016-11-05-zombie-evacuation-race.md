Run for your life through a 5km course dodging the UNDEAD and navigating a multitude of challenging obstacles designed specifically to slow down your escape from relentless ZOMBIE horde.

We cannot reveal too much of the course description as it will be a surprise for the evacuees but they can expect to be running through fields, woods and trails. This race also includes a stadium finish on the home grounds of the Saracens rugby team!

The evacuees will encounter obstacles, however they will have the option to walk around the obstacle and there is no water based parts of the course. The main obstacle that the evacuees will encounter will be the living dead! However, these 'obstacles' are strictly non-contact.
