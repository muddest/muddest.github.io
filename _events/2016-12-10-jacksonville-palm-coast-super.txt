The Reebok Spartan Super: This is our middle distance course. With a longer distance than the Sprint and more obstacles, the Super will test your endurance, perseverance and grit. The 8-10 Mile Super packs more than 25 Signature Spartan Obstacles through tougher and more rugged terrain. The Super is the test en route to your Spartan TRIFECTA.

We’ve tested out the terrain at Florida Cracker Ranch (FCR), and we can now say with some certainty that hell is not made of ice or lakes of burning sulphur—it’s made out of mud. There are no hills here—it’s Florida—but don’t think that this course will show you Southern hospitality: what FCR lacks in elevation it makes up for in sticky, soul-crushing, shoe-stealing swamp.

You might not personally identify as a Cowboy, but after you survive the onslaught of obstacles we’ve planned for this Reebok Spartan Super and Sprint, you’ll discover that, deep down, you have the same tough, gritty center and rugged, unstoppable spirit as the best of them. Join us for the chance to redefine “demanding,” battle your swamp demons, and do what you thought was impossible.
