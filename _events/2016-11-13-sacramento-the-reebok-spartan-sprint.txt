The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

Van Vleck Ranch is the closest thing Reebok Spartan Race has on its calendar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. If the weather remains dry, you will be confronted with an arduous, rolling landscape that goes as far as the eye can see. Should it rain, you will be presented with one of the most technical terrains you could hope to encounter -- it will become slippery and the slopes will become a battle for even the most seasoned racer.

That’s what makes Sacramento such a special venue. Prairies that are normally home to the cattle may seem timid at first glance, but this venue lulls you into a false sense of security. The lakes on the venue have a clay that will stick to you and bog you down if you let it. The hills, while not high, are relentless and roll on for mile after mile. Add in the wind that rushes over the venue and you have the perfect cocktail of terrain, the elements, and of course, obstacles to test your mettle.

Such is the popularity of this northern California venue, that many southern Californians - and those from further afield – make the annual pilgrimage to one of the most exciting events on the calendar. Remember that should the weather take a turn for the worse, you’re a Spartan, and Spartans never surrender.
