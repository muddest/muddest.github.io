Are you ready for a muddy challenge? Get ready for the steepest, most grueling Tough Mudder course in Europe along the hills of the historic Herdringen Castle.

Tough Mudder is a team-oriented 10-12 mile (18-20 km) obstacle course designed to test physical strength and mental grit. Tough Mudder presented by Merrell puts camaraderie over finisher rankings and is not a race but a team challenge. We are for anyone who has ever followed their gut, tried to defy gravity, chosen “dare” over “truth,” taken risks, sought thrills, or is generally awesome at life. Turns out, it’s all been training. We are Tough Mudder.
