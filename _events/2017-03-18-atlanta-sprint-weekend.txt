The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

If you were to make a checklist of the ideal Spartan Race terrain, you could check-off a number of things at the Reebok Spartan Race in Conyers, Georgia. This course offers hills, forests, rough terrain, mud, more hills, and of course, single and doubletrack trails. Ideally, a Spartan-worthy venue would have all of these boxes checked. Centennial Olympic Parkway proudly has all of these elements in abundance -- making this a popular venue.

The famous thick, red clay here makes for the most infamous mud on the Spartan calendar, but that’s not the only reason to attack the course. One of the most daunting yet exciting obstacles in the form of the huge cargo climb is something seasoned racers prepare with regularity. The only question is, will the race directors include it again?

This venue was home to the 1966 Olympic Equestrian events, so keep training your legs, you’ll need plenty of horsepower to negotiate the technical trails and the rolling hills.
