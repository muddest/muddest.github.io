We're heading back to Hof Severloh in 2017 and pushing you farther than ever before. Get ready to come face to face with dark woodlands, deep lakes & bogs and thick, swamp-like mud at Tough Mudder Norddeutschland Presented by Merrell.

Tough Mudder is a team-oriented 10-12 mile (18-20 km) obstacle course designed to test physical strength and mental grit. Tough Mudder presented by Merrell puts camaraderie over finisher rankings and is not a race but a team challenge. We are for anyone who has ever followed their gut, tried to defy gravity, chosen “dare” over “truth,” taken risks, sought thrills, or is generally awesome at life. Turns out, it’s all been training. We are Tough Mudder.
