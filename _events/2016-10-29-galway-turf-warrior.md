The Turf Guy course will be approx 10km long but don’t let this short distance fool you into thinking that it won’t test your endurance!

We have built lots of elements throughout the course which tested your fitness, endurance, mental strength! As it was a long winter and a very wet summer we have had a lot of spare time to come up with more weird and wonderful elements, so you never know what you might find around the corner this year!!!

There is approx an 5km run/jog at the beginning of the course to spread out the field of competitors and reduce the congestion at certain elements. However please be aware that there may be a little wait at some elements, if waiting you can either help fellow competitors complete the obstacle of just watch them struggle! Expect to be running through the energy sapping Connemara bog, jumping into the pure waters of Killary Fjord and scrambling over many an obstacle put in your path!

Please be warned that your clothing will get extremely wet and dirty. You do not need any special skills for the course but will need some upper body strength for some elements of the course, and must be comfortable in waist deep water. Also you will be climbing through, under and over trees, fallen trees, climbing ropes, jumping off obstacles and much more so you may receive cuts, bruises and grazes.

We highly reccommend that you wear full body cover, not just shorts and T shirt!
