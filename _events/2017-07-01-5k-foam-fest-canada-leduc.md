Infotext:  The obstacles won’t be easy and some are inherently dangerous—so be careful and don’t try and do anything beyond your skill level. If you are questioning your physical/mental capabilities or have a medical condition please consult with your physician before signing up for the run. You are responsible for avoiding an obstacle if you feel you are unable to complete that particular part of the course. This is your run remember! Mud is fun but only when it’s safe!

Whether it’s your mother, brother, boyfriend, or twice removed cousin, grab anyone you can think of and get prepared to get FOAMY.

You’ll need bodies, not only to create a fun and foamtastic atmosphere, but hey maybe you could use your team mate as a stepping stool for the climbing walls, or a flotation device for the muddy madness?

Your team can be as big as you want (the more the merrier) BUT remember, the only way to make sure you all get to run at the same time is to register early and in the same wave time, so don’t wait! Otherwise we can’t guarantee that you’ll be flying around in foam with your friends. Register now and let your friends know you have so they can do the same!

What in the world could possibly be more fun than running through a course chucked full of mud, foam, and obstacles? Running through it with your friends, of course!
