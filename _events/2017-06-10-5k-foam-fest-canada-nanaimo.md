Whether it’s your mother, brother, boyfriend, or twice removed cousin, grab anyone you can think of and get prepared to get FOAMY.

You’ll need bodies, not only to create a fun and foamtastic atmosphere, but hey maybe you could use your team mate as a stepping stool for the climbing walls, or a flotation device for the muddy madness?

Your team can be as big as you want (the more the merrier) BUT remember, the only way to make sure you all get to run at the same time is to register early and in the same wave time, so don’t wait! Otherwise we can’t guarantee that you’ll be flying around in foam with your friends. Register now and let your friends know you have so they can do the same!

What in the world could possibly be more fun than running through a course chucked full of mud, foam, and obstacles? Running through it with your friends, of course!
