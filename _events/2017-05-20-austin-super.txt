The Reebok Spartan Super: This is our middle distance course. With a longer distance than the Sprint and more obstacles, the Super will test your endurance, perseverance and grit. The 8-10 Mile Super packs more than 25 Signature Spartan Obstacles through tougher and more rugged terrain. The Super is the test en route to your Spartan TRIFECTA.

Welcome to Reveille Peak Ranch. Located in Burnet, Texas, this ranch offers over 62 miles that wind and weave through fields of wildflowers and cacti, dry creek beds, and exposed granite outcroppings -- all the makings of an authentic Texan Spartan Race.

Expect a course packed with single track descents, rugged rock climbs, muddy waters and obstacles... a whole lot of obstacles. In addition to all the traditional ropes climbs, heavy carries, and low crawls, you’ll have a slew of natural obstacles unique to this setting. Water crossing, anyone? Don’t worry, it’s shallow (enough).
