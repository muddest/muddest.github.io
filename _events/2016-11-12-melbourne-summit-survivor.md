There are 36 obstacles in just 5km, that’s an average of 7.2 obstacles per kilometre. So what will you be up against? A hell of a lot!
All obstacles have been carefully designed to test you regardless of whether you’re an office-working novice or a hardened, crossfitting elite. In fact, out of all our test-racers who recently pioneered the course, 87% said they found it the “ideal difficulty”

There will be roving first aid officers at the event. There will also be water stations throughout the event.
