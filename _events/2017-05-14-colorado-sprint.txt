The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

Welcome to Fort Carson Army Base. Earn the bragging rights of overcoming obstacles designed by the 4th Infantry and Specials Forces units in addition to the traditional Signature Spartan obstacles. This course is as challenging and inspiring as it gets -- you’re at high-elevation and you’re surrounded by Spartans on a military base. This is an experience you’ll be sure to appreciate long after you conquer the course.

You’ll be tested against tough obstacles and of course, you’ll do your burpees to earn your finisher medal on the same terrain and crucibles that have continued to test this country’s finest servicemen and servicewomen.
