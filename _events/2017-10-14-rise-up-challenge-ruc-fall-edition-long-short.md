Infotext: The Rise Up Challenge (RUC); which stands for Resistance, Integrity, Strength and Endurance, is a one of a kind event in the heart of the city, pairing obstacle course racing (OCR), trail running and a dash of orienteering to create a unique experience. RUC will play off your physical and mental strengths (and weaknesses) to help redefine your limits and push you to new heights! Each event focuses on utilizing the obstacles and roadblocks found within the city, nature and the surrounding environment to not only challenge you individually, but in some cases, require you to work together to succeed.

At each event we offer two options to create opportunity for teams and individuals to choose the experience to best suit their abilities and how far they want to push themselves. SHORTY and LONG SHOT

What is RUC: Long Shot? A course that offers the traditional RUC experience that our reputation is known for. “That was the hardest race I have ever done” is commonly used by participants once they finish. Long Shot should appeal to those who are looking to really push their limits and can handle the extra workload. Courses will run between 10 – 15 Miles in distance and may take 4 – 8 Hrs to complete if not more. Along the course, racers will run in to a plethora of obstacles that will test their physical and mental limits and raise their bar!
