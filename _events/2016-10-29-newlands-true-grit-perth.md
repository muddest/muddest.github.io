True Grit is the first Australian designed military style obstacle course

The obstacle course has been designed to test your mental resolve and stamina, with an emphasis on tackling obstacles, not running a marathon. Our courses are designed over 10-12km with over 30 obstacles per event.

We design our layouts based on our military experience, by utilising unique obstacles tailored around the vegetation and terrain of the land. Our aim is to deliver a truly unique experience to those that dare.
