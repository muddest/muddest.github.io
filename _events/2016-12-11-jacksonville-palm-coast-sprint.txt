The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

We’ve tested out the terrain at Florida Cracker Ranch (FCR), and we can now say with some certainty that hell is not made of ice or lakes of burning sulphur—it’s made out of mud. There are no hills here—it’s Florida—but don’t think that this course will show you Southern hospitality: what FCR lacks in elevation it makes up for in sticky, soul-crushing, shoe-stealing swamp.

You might not personally identify as a Cowboy, but after you survive the onslaught of obstacles we’ve planned for this Reebok Spartan Super and Sprint, you’ll discover that, deep down, you have the same tough, gritty center and rugged, unstoppable spirit as the best of them. Join us for the chance to redefine “demanding,” battle your swamp demons, and do what you thought was impossible.
