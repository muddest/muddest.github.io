The 11th of March we will bring Mount Everest to Flottsbro in Stockholm.

The obstacle course mirrors the conditions at Mount Everest. During this adventurous sport event, you will be running through snow blizzards, climbing over crevasses, pulling yourself up over ice walls and getting the opportunity to experience the thin air that you actually find above 8000 meters height.

Overall you will run up and down Flottsbro 5 times, the total prominence is 600 meters and the distance is 9km.

In order to participate the only thing, you need is a helmet, workout clothes, gloves, sports spectacles and a pair of shoes with a nice and firm grip.

The total prominence for juniors is 250m and 4km long.

Walk over crevasses, avoid avalanches, survive hurricane winds, thin air and steep climbs. Many are those who dream about reaching the top, but few are those who succeed. Are you tough enough? It’s You Vs. The Mountain.
