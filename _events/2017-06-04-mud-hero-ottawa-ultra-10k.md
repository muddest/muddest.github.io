Infotext: Mud Heroes looking for the next challenge should look no further than our NEW Ultra 10k! What takes our Ultra 10k to the next level is more than just the extra distance; we feature five harder challenges on top of the obstacles and mud featured in our traditional 6 km event. These include Brick and Morter, Turf and Surf, True North Climb, Top Out and Hole Punch plus assorted obstacles featuring hard or easy options.

Is the Ultra 10k for me?

Even more of the Muddiest. Challenge. EVER.

Are you a Mud Hero veteran looking for the next challenge? Want to try something a little tougher, but still jam packed with fun? While there won’t be any electric shock or burpees to contend with, Mud Hero Ultra obstacles are more physically demanding. The 10K course features 25+ obstacles, and the same 10,000 watt after-party! Remember, if the obstacle is too hard, you have the option of doing an easy variation, or skipping it (no burpees required!)
