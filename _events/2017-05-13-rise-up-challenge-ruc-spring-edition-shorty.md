The Rise Up Challenge (RUC); which stands for Resistance, Integrity, Strength and Endurance, is a one of a kind event in the heart of the city, pairing obstacle course racing (OCR), trail running and a dash of orienteering to create a unique experience. RUC will play off your physical and mental strengths (and weaknesses) to help redefine your limits and push you to new heights! Each event focuses on utilizing the obstacles and roadblocks found within the city, nature and the surrounding environment to not only challenge you individually, but in some cases, require you to work together to succeed.

At each event we offer two options to create opportunity for teams and individuals to choose the experience to best suit their abilities and how far they want to push themselves. SHORTY and LONG SHOT

What is RUC: Shorty? A smaller version of the RUC experience, built inside the traditional RUC event. Shorty is meant to give those that are new to OCR or are accustomed to competing in 5 – 10 Km courses, a taste of the Rise Up Challenge unique and creative style of racing. Courses will run between 4 – 6 Miles in distance and may take 1 – 3 Hrs to complete. Along the course, racers will run in to several roadblocks and obstacles that will test their physical and mental limits.
