Awesome Venue, New Course
Tough Mudder Scotland Presented by Merrell is back at Drumlanrig Castle in 2017 and we're taking it to the next level. Just don't think we'll allow you to soak up the breathtaking scenery. Instead we'll make sure you're find it hard taking a breath while soaking in loads of thick mud.

10 â€“ 12 Miles, 20+ Obstacles
Prepare to take on a suit of our best obstacles while you run up and over gut-busting hills, navigate dark wooded trails, and crawl through the best mud Scotland has to offer. Get your team together, you're going to need all the help you can get.
