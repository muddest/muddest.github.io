The Reebok Spartan Super: This is our middle distance course. With a longer distance than the Sprint and more obstacles, the Super will test your endurance, perseverance and grit. The 8-10 Mile Super packs more than 25 Signature Spartan Obstacles through tougher and more rugged terrain. The Super is the test en route to your Spartan TRIFECTA.

According to Miwok and Ohlone mythology, Mount Diablo is the place where the world began.

It’s happening again, and you’re invited.

Under the warm glow of the California sun, Spartans will come together to brave heat and hills on an expansive range of wooded trails. On a low, ancient savannah rich with legend, thousands of Spartans will join in celebration, vie for glory, and enjoy the renewal that only comes after a day of relentless drive.

That, or they will bow at the feet of the unforgiving, blood-red Mount Diablo.

Scenic Diablo Grande is a 30,000-acre ranch, resort, and nature park in Diablo Grande, CA. Just 30 minutes from Modesto, this wide-open space lets Spartans make a complete escape from the madness of modern life—without dropping them in the remotest wilderness. After the race, or between heats, Spartans can easily visit the city for a much-needed rest and recharge. One hour west by car, beautiful San Francisco offers Spartans more healthy and delicious ways to dine than we can list here.
