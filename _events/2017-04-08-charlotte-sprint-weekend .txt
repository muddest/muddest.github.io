The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

Spartan Race is pleased to return to Porter Farms, a 600-acre family owned and operated establishment in the peaceful town of Concord, North Carolina. The 3+ mile course will be spread out over 100 acres of land that typically plays home to peaceful pastures on a sprawling farm, but on this weekend it will transform into an outlet for the passionate Spartan community.

Despite being a fast and flat course, this venue provides racers with an array of difficult challenges that are guaranteed to push each participant to their limit. Don’t miss out on kicking off your Spartan season with this fun, yet challenging, Spartan Sprint.
