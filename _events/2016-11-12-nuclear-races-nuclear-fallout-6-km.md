Infotext: The wetter, colder and muddier race; the one you need to train for – take it for granted and it’ll bite you. It’s our last event of the year, so we throw everything at it – every obstacle Nuclear has is included and the 6km and 12km courses are muddier than any other time of the year. 

Hypothermia isn’t uncommon – cuts, bruises, scrapes and sores are all abundant. 

We’ve over 60 natural and man-made obstacles all on hilly, undulating farmland and heavy Essex Clay – so duck-taping your trainers on isn’t a bad idea!
