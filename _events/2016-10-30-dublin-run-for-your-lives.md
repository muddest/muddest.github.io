Your mission as a survivor is a simple one - Survive. The only thing standing between you and the Safe Zone is a challenging obstacle course laced with the Infected.
You will begin with 3 lives, represented by tags attached to a belt around your waist. These are like magnets to the Infected. Get to the Safe Zone with at least one life remaining to earn your status as a True Survivor. Use your skill, speed and agility and avoid the Infected at all costs!
