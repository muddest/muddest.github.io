You could spend your Saturday running errands or binge-watching TV, but wouldn’t it be more fun to do something absolutely insane with your friends?!

Picture this:  You arrive at Chicopee Ski Resort in Kitchener on June 3rd with a carload of your most adventurous friends. As you step out you notice the people around you admiring your group’s coordinated “Avengers-in-bathing-suits” costumes and your on-point Hulk-green body paint. In the festival, people are already riding the mechanical bull and playing beach volleyball (Rugged Maniac is definitely more than just a mud run), but you’re more interested in the stein-hoisting contest on the main stage.  You make a note to sign up for that and the pie-eating contest after you run.   You see obstacles in the distance – mud-covered people jumping over fire, bouncing on trampolines, rocketing down a huge water slide – and your surging excitement confirms what you already knew: Today is going to be awesome!

Stop daydreaming.  Grab your friends and get your tickets now!
