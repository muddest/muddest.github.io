The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

Welcome to Averill’s Flathead Lake Lodge. Spartans, prepare for the glorious views, and rewarding climbs. This venue is located directly on the shores of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi.

Take in a breath of Big Sky Country’s fresh air. This course is pristine and the trails are rugged. The arduous terrain (covering 12+ miles) and punishing obstacles will leave you breathless at the finish line. The views of Glacier National Park are not to be missed; and yes, you’ll just have to climb a hill, and crawl under barbed wire, then throw a spear, and of course, traverse across a cargo net, just to get there. But trust us, the reward for your hard work is more than worth it.
