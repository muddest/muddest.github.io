The Battlefield Challenge is 7km’s long with over 40 obstacles. The event is suitable for every level of fitness from first time mud runner/obstacle racer couch potato, to seasoned weekend warriors! Designed and led by Soldier Dan you will take part in a genuine military themed obstacle course.

Above all the course is a lot of fun and the perfect way to spend the day getting down and dirty with your mates. We even provide you the clothes to get dirty in.

On arrival you’ll be issued genuine Army fatigues (cams), sit through a realistic military mission brief, collect the rest of your gear and marched to the start line by our experienced military personnel.
Once on the course our instructors will even help you through, over and under any obstacles to make sure you and your team complete the course with no man or women left behind.

You can run, walk or crawl around the course as an individual or in a team. This is not a race and more designed for fun and laugher whilst providing life long memories and a unique achievement.
