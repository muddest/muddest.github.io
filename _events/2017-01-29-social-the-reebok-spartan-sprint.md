The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

Pala Raceway is a motocross or dirtbiker's dream. Featuring 6 different tracks each with varying levels of difficulty, riders of any skill set can enjoy the Pala's tracks while taking in the scenery of the surrounding Palomar Mountain State Park.

Spartans on this course should expect more of what they're already used to; sweat, mud, and a challenging yet positive race with a beautiful mountainous backdrop.

Pala happens to be only an hour north of San Diego, perfect for making a day trip to see the sights San Diego has to offer before returning to the mountainous seclusion of Pala to prepare for one of the most scenically stunning Spartan venues. Should San Diego prove to be too far of a trip to consider making, beautiful Pala, California features the Pala Casino Hotel and Resort, a new RV Park, and several wineries and cellars thanks to the countless vineyards surrounding the area.
