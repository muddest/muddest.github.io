The Reebok Spartan Super: This is our middle distance course. With a longer distance than the Sprint and more obstacles, the Super will test your endurance, perseverance and grit. The 8-10 Mile Super packs more than 25 Signature Spartan Obstacles through tougher and more rugged terrain. The Super is the test en route to your Spartan TRIFECTA.

Welcome to Seattle, the heart of the Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Northwest offers a little of everything in terms of terrain: mountainous trails, rolling hills, creeks, rocky byways and trees in every direction. With so many towering trees and natural scenery as far as your eyes can see, you won’t even know you’re so close to Seattle at this venue.
