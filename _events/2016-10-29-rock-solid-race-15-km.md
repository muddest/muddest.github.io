Our Milton Keynes event is staged at the stunning Silverstone Woodlands.

As the home of ROCKSOLID RACE, it’s where you’ll find our most inventive obstacles to push you and your muscles to the max!

On top of that, you’ll face your fears, our finest mud and the best facilities of any obstacle course race on the planet, bar none.

You and your team are ready to beat Bambi, smash through Summit Plummet and boss The Bomb. So don’t miss training folks – you’ll be showing your team exactly what you’re made of!

You’re going to get wet right through, totally muddy, and you’re going to laugh more than you ever thought possible. You start the day as a ROCKSOLID RACE Contender, but you’re going to earn a Champion’s reward…

Once you cross the line, our legendary free hot showers will be a total lifesaver after an afternoon knee deep in the elements!

Post race, it’s time to grab a beer and check out the kick-ass after-party!

Don’t forget your tent! We’ve got awesome camping facilities, so you can keep the party going late into the night!
