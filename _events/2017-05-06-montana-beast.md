The Reebok Spartan Beast: This is our most difficult of the three. The Beast will test not only your endurance, perseverance and grit, but also your mind. The 12-14 Mile Beast packs more than 30 Signature Spartan Obstacles and your final hurdle to Spartan TRIFECTA glory. It won’t be easy but you can’t believe how good the medal feels at the finish line.

Welcome to Averill’s Flathead Lake Lodge. Spartans, prepare for the glorious views, and rewarding climbs. This venue is located directly on the shores of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi.

Take in a breath of Big Sky Country’s fresh air. This course is pristine and the trails are rugged. The arduous terrain (covering 12+ miles) and punishing obstacles will leave you breathless at the finish line. The views of Glacier National Park are not to be missed; and yes, you’ll just have to climb a hill, and crawl under barbed wire, then throw a spear, and of course, traverse across a cargo net, just to get there. But trust us, the reward for your hard work is more than worth it.
