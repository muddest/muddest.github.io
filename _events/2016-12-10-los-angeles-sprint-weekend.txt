The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

About 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and just a little ways from Santa Clarita, sits Castaic Lake State Recreation Area. A hidden jewel of the Southern California crown, it is home to beloved trails for hikers and mountain bikers.

The numerous miles of trails will certainly test the Spartan community. There’s also a good chance that this course could venture close (or even into) the lake. Given the views from the camping areas, spectators and well-wishers can expect to be treated to some stunning scenery, and witness their loved ones grappling with the many obstacles.

The steep trails will offer a true test. Should it happen to rain, this will quickly become one of the muddiest races on the Spartan Race calendar.
