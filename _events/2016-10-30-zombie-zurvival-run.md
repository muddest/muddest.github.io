The Zombie Zurvival Run, which is confirmed to be strictly for over 5s, (children aged 5 â€“ 11 must be accompanied by an adult) is set in the open fields of Cheshunt Park where teams of survivors must make a 5km dash to the last known evacuation point whilst navigating their way through a number of apocalyptic obstacles and an army of the undead.
