Viking Race Asgard is a 10 kilometer obstacle race, and the next step up in the Viking Race series. Be ware that in addition to a longer distance, the obstacles in Viking Race Asgard are also tougher than in Viking Race Midgard - still, everyone should be able to finish a Viking Race Asgard.
If you skip or fail an obstacle in Midgard or Asgard you will have to complete10 or 20 burpees respectively. Burpees are not a pentalty. Burpees will give you time to reflect on why you were unable to complete the obstacle, and what you will have to work on to be able to complete it the next time you race.

Bag check is available for 20 NOK at the race venue.

For Viking Race Kids the age limit for participation in Viking Race Kids is 3-8 years. The obstacles are in mini-versions of the grown up race and we believe children older than 8y will be bored in this course, unfortunately. For Oslo-event in 2017 we will have a mass-start for the kids race at 14.00 on Saturday 26th and Sunday 27st of August. All kids receive a t-shirt.

Norwayâ€™s biggest obstacle race inspired by the Viking age and Norse mythology.
