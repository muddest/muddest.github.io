The Reebok Spartan Super: This is our middle distance course. With a longer distance than the Sprint and more obstacles, the Super will test your endurance, perseverance and grit. The 8-10 Mile Super packs more than 25 Signature Spartan Obstacles through tougher and more rugged terrain. The Super is the test en route to your Spartan TRIFECTA.

Welcome to Fort Carson Army Base. Earn the bragging rights of overcoming obstacles designed by the 4th Infantry and Specials Forces units in addition to the traditional Signature Spartan obstacles. This course is as challenging and inspiring as it gets -- you’re at high-elevation and you’re surrounded by Spartans on a military base. This is an experience you’ll be sure to appreciate long after you conquer the course.

You’ll be tested against tough obstacles and of course, you’ll do your burpees to earn your finisher medal on the same terrain and crucibles that have continued to test this country’s finest servicemen and servicewomen.
