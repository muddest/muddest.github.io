The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

If you were to make a cocktail of the sun, punishing obstacles, and a muddy course designed for off-road motorbikes, you would have the venue that will be waiting for you at the Las Vegas Super and Sprint.

At Mesquite MX/Haven Ranch in Littlefield, Arizona, a new chapter of Reebok Spartan Race will challenge those brave enough to tackle a venue that typically requires engines and wheels. Located only a short drive from Las Vegas, this course is just as fast as the Nevada nightlife. At an elevation that never exceeds 900 feet, this course suits runners of all ages and abilities.

Always keen to keep racers on their toes, Spartan Race will build a challenging course of comprised of at least eight miles of rough, muddy, technical terrain that will put your grit, speed and determination to the test.
