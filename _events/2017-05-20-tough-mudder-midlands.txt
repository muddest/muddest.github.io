Awesome Venue, New Course
In 2017 we are taking you back to the EPIC grounds of Belvoir Castle for Tough Mudder Midlands Presented by Merrell. The majestic16,000 acres surrounding the castle will once again play host to miles of the tortuous course and a twisted collection of new and classic Tough Mudder obstacles.

You and your team are going to need to bring some serious mental grit to make it around this course which promises lung-busting hills in addition to woodlands, water and yes, tons and tons of mud. Don't contemplate it for too long, just sign up and gather your friends. You're going to need them.
