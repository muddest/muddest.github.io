The Reebok Spartan Sprint: This is our shortest distance. It is perfect for athletes of all levels; from Spartan first timers to seasoned racers. The 3-5 Mile Sprint may be our shortest distance but it packs more than 20 Signature Spartan Obstacles. If you think you can’t do it, you’re wrong. Get to the starting line and show yourself what you are capable of.

Welcome to Reveille Peak Ranch. Located in Burnet, Texas, this ranch offers over 62 miles that wind and weave through fields of wildflowers and cacti, dry creek beds, and exposed granite outcroppings -- all the makings of an authentic Texan Spartan Race.

Expect a course packed with single track descents, rugged rock climbs, muddy waters and obstacles... a whole lot of obstacles. In addition to all the traditional ropes climbs, heavy carries, and low crawls, you’ll have a slew of natural obstacles unique to this setting. Water crossing, anyone? Don’t worry, it’s shallow (enough).
