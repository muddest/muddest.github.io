Heavy Metal meets Fisherman's Friend StrongmanRun! Full of mud, wild hordes, 20 km, 40 obstacles. A setting that is made for you. We speak of Wacken! This year we want to see you walk in Schleswig-Holstein and have it searched us the perfect location. It is naturally loud and heavy!
We are sure to have found us the perfect place to write new Fisherman's Friend StrongmanRun stories. And one thing is clear: no running shoe remains dry. Wacken will rock. Of course, also catered for rookies. If you want to run only half the distance, the logs on as genuine Fisherman's Friend StrongmanRun Rookie and rocks, 10 km!
